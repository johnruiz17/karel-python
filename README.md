## Title
Karel the Robot - World Completion Assistant

## Description
This project utilizes Karel, a teaching robot, to complete various tasks within simulated worlds. It includes three Python programs:

* **CheckerboardKarel.py:** Creates a checkerboard pattern using beepers.
* **CollectNewspaperKarel.py:** Instructs Karel to navigate its house, pick up a newspaper (represented by a beeper), and return home.
* **StoneMasonKarel.py:** Helps Karel "repair the quad" by filling in missing beepers in designated columns.
* **MidpointKarel.py:** Guides Karel to locate the midpoint of a row and mark it with a beeper.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Stanford Karel libraries

## Installation

1. Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download the Karel libraries following the instructions provided by your instructor or from the Stanford Karel website.
3. Save the Python files (CheckerboardKarel.py, CollectNewspaperKarel.py, StoneMasonKarel.py, and MidpointKarel.py) in your preferred working directory.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the files.
2. To run each program individually, execute the following command, replacing filename.py with the actual filename:
   
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

For example, to run CheckerboardKarel.py:
```bash
python3 CheckerboardKarel.py
```
